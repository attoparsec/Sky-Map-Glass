Sky Map for Glass

This code is really two different things:
   * A quick and dirty hack to make Sky Map work better with Google Glass
   * A new "Continents" layer which shows the outlines of the contents as if the Earth was transparent

The first aspects consists of several small tweaks:
   * Removed the spash screen
   * Removed the EULA which couldn't be clicked on
   * Moved night mode toggle to the options menu
   * Removed items from the options menu which wouldn't work on Glass
   * Made the options menu accessible with a single tap

The second uses data from the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg_coastline/) to render outlines of the world's landmasses. These are crudely simplified because otherwise the Sky Map renderer would drop many of the lines. The lat/lons are converted to celestial coordinates in a modification to GeocentricCoordinates.java.
