    Classes related to controlling the astronomer's state, which is stored
    in {@link com.google.android.stardroid.control.AstronomerModel}.
    Most of this package consists of a number of
    different Controllers that change the astronomer's state according to some
    external input (e.g. sensors, the ticking of a clock).  These are all
    accessed by external clients through the ControllerGroup.
